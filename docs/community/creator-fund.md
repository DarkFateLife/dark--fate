# The DarkFateLife Creator Fund

The DarkFateLife Creator Fund is an initiative designed to support and empower developers, creators, and community members who are building the future of autonomous AI agents.

## The Story Behind the Fund

The DarkFateLife Creator Fund was made possible by the generosity of Elijah, a significant holder of DarkFateLife tokens. Elijah has pledged to donate a portion of his holdings, reducing his ownership from 16% to 5%, to establish a dedicated fund that will support promising developers and creators.

The donated funds will be held in a dedicated wallet (`9YnQdCWDAQRfQYm5HvRzoPgc5GRn8fyhsH2eru8nfsxG`) and distributed via Streamflow token vesting contracts. This approach ensures that creators receive a steady stream of DarkFateLife tokens over time as they hit milestones and deliver value to the ecosystem.

## Benefits and Vision

The DarkFateLife Creator Fund aims to:

- Bootstrap and reward an ecosystem of innovative creators building on DarkFateLife
- Give creators the runway to focus on their work without worrying about short-term token prices
- Put Elijah's tokens to productive use in growing the DarkFateLife community, rather than through a one-time event
- Reduce the risk of token dumping by aligning creators' interests with the long-term success of the project
- Bring more talent and energy into the DarkFateLife ecosystem to drive innovation and adoption

By providing ongoing sponsorship and recognizing creators' efforts, the fund will help cultivate a thriving community of builders who will take DarkFateLife to the next level.

## Next Steps

We are currently working on finalizing the details of the DarkFateLife Creator Fund, including:

- Determining the size of the creator fund and the length of vesting schedules
- Establishing a transparent creator grant application and selection process
- Integrating Streamflow to manage token vesting contracts for selected grantees
- Preparing to announce the first cohort of funded creators and share their exciting projects with the community

Stay tuned for more information on how to apply for grants from the DarkFateLife Creator Fund. In the meantime, creators and developers are encouraged to start brainstorming ideas and preparing their applications.

## A Note on Liquidity

In addition to the Creator Fund, we are also exploring OTC (over-the-counter) deals to onboard new partners and use the funds to lock in more liquidity for the DarkFateLife ecosystem. This approach will help ensure a healthy and sustainable token economy as we continue to grow and evolve.
