# GitHub Contributors

This is a quick and dirty implementation of profiles that are programmatically generated from github data from `DarkFateLife/darkfate` repo. I'm looking for some help to integrate into Docusaurus as react components. See the code for generating profiles here: https://github.com/DarkFateLife/DarkFateLife.github.io

<iframe 
  src="https://DarkFateLife.github.io/profiles/index.html" 
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '100vh',
    border: 'none',
  }}
/>
